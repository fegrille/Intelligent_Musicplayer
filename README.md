# Intelligent_Musicplayer

This is our UbiCom-Projekt where we want to implement a music player app. We will add a arduino uno microcontroller board, some bluetooth spots and bluetooth loudspeaker. The main idea behind this projekt is a connection to intelligent home. When someone hears music while he's comming home he normally takes of his headphones but he really don't want to stop to listen to his music. We want to implement a system that will switch the music output from headphones to loudspeakers at home. Furthermore we want a intelligent home application that will detect the room where the person stands to switch the output to this room. Requirements for this system is that the person carry his smart phone with him. The system will detect at which of the bluetooth spots the person is nearer and play the music in this room.
